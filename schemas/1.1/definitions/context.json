    "description": "When two people communicate with one another, the conversation takes place in a shared environment, typically called \"the context of the conversation\". This shared context allows the individuals to use shortcut terms, like the first name of a mutual friend, to communicate more quickly but without losing accuracy. A context in JSON-LD works in the same way. It allows two applications to use shortcut terms to communicate with one another more efficiently, but without losing accuracy.",
